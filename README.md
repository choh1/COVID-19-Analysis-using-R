# COVID-19-Analysis-using-R

Project Description:

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the most outrageously spreading
disease worldwide, in which the disease is relatively recent and unknown before the outbreak began in December 2019. Although COVID-19 may not be fatal, it can make people ill for the certain vulnerable populations who previously had any health conditions or for the older population (WHO). It has been reported by the CDC that there are 4,280,135 total cases, 147,672 total deaths, 1306 cases per 100,000 people cumulatively in the USA.
Source 1 dataset shows conditions that contribute to causes of deaths associated with COVID-19 and source 2 dataset shows deaths involved with COVID-19, pneumonia and influenza along with the race, age and states. Both of the datasets are exported from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and are only representing population in the United States, where the data was created in May 9, 2020 and updated on July 23, 2020. The objective of this study is to find any correlation with COVID-19 and other variables including various underlying conditions with different age groups.

Data:
Source1: Conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID 19), by age group and state, United States.
https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Conditions-contributing-to-deaths-involving-corona/hk9y-
quqm
  Number of rows(samples, n): 8,060
  Number of columns(predictors, x): 10
Source 2: Deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) by race and Hispanic origin group and age, by state. https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Deaths-involving-coronavirus-disease-2019-COVID-19/ks 3g-spdg
  Number of rows(samples, n): 4,761
  Number of columns(predictors, x): 13


Hypothesis:
The hypothesis of this study is that as age increases, and any pre-existing medical condition there were, people will become more vulnerable to be infected by the disease. 

Inclusion:
People tested and diagnosed with COVID-19 during the timeframe (2/1/20-7/18/20) in US
Exclusion:
Healthy population who were not tested for COVID-19
Population outside of the US
